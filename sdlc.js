/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation

// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

//Answer: 
//Planning
//Analysis of Requirements
//Design
//Implementation
//Testing & Integration
//Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
let analysisofRequirements = "The second step is to figure out what programs or features are required to get through the problem that you are trying to solve."
let design = "This is where the developers will model how the program is going to fit together from the front end to the back end and everything in between."
let implementation = "This is where the code is made and all of the planning and designing gets developed using code."
let testingandIntegration = "The software is then stress tested to see if all of the systems work together and then the software is depolyed."
let maintain = "This is where bugs are fixed and code is maintained to prevent code issues."
